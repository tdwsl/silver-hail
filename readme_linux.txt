By default, the game comes with a 64-bit Linux executable 'hail'. To run this,
you will need SDL2 and SDL2_mixer installed.

To do this on Ubuntu 21.04, you could use the following command:
"sudo apt update && sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0'

For other architectures or operating systems, see README.md for tips on
compiling.
